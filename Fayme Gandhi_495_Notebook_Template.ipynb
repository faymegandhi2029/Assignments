This workflow will provide insights on the microstructural changes due to shear deformation.\n","\n","The raw data file will contain the following information for each time measured within a specific step: the stress, the shear rate, and the time of each measurement. After uploading this data, I will filter out the known limitations of the instrument (such as torque limit and stress limit) and the time range for each step conducted of the data (since it takes 1-2 seconds to reach desired shear rate).\n","\n","To visualize the data, plots of stress vs shear rate, viscosity vs shear rate, preshear vs shear rate, and stress/viscosity vs time will be generated. These plots provide us an idea of how the fluid is behaving overall thinning or thickening), if time-dependent behavior is present, and force required for the fluid to flow.\n","\n","I will use the Herschel-Bulkley model to quantify how shear deformation changes the rheological properties in a non-Newtonian fluid. The following model parameters will be predicted from my filtered data: the yield stress, the exponent for flow behavior (to categorize if shear-thinning, thickening, Newtonian), and the consistency index (relates viscosity of the fluid).\n","\n","From the parameters obtained, we can compare model predications to experimental data through error analysis to determine measurement accuracy. If there are significant errors after repeated trials, this indicates microstructural changes in the slurry during shear.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"OjtEHT-a8b3K"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Prior Work\n","\n","Reference 1: Physical scaling for predicting shear viscosity and memory effects for lithium-ion battery cathode slurries (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39876829/)\n","\n","In this paper, cathode slurry component compositions were manipulated to understand the role each component contriuted in the rheology.
